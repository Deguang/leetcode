Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

# solution 1:
use two-sum solution, find out the solution for a number as the target(0-number) of two-sum, if yes, return result, if not, return;
